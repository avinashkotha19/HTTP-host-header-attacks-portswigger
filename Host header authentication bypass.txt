Lab: Host header authentication bypass

steps:
1. send the GET  / request which has a status code : 200 to burp repeater. Notice that the request contains host.
2. Change the host name to hyper123 and send the request again. Again the request has a status code is 200.
3. browse for /robots.txt there you can found that admin panel at /admin.
4. Browse for /admin. You don't have to  access the admin panel. But you got a error message which is only accessed by local users.
5. Send the GET /admin from HTTP history to repeater and change the hostname to localhost. Send the request.
6. You can observe that you can access the admin panel. Now change the request line form GET /admin to GET /admin/delete?username=carlos and send the request to delete the "carlos" to solve the lab.
